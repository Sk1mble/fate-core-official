# Version 3.0.6
  * No errors now thrown on trying to open FateUtilities with no scene active.
  * Fate Utilities only opens automatically if no canvas and no canvas setting turned on.
  * Characters now refresh when a game setting is changed.

# Version 3.0.5
  * Disabling the canvas now causes FateUtilities to be opened on load.
  * Added a 'Check All' button and an 'Uncheck All' button to the GM skill editor for a character.
  * Improved layout of skill editor window & GM skill editor window in respect of scrolling etc.

# Version 3.0.4 
  * Got rid of the need for a timeout in some code.

# Version 3.0.2 - 3.03
  * Fixed some issues with Thing manipulation. There were errors being caused by various issues due to the three different use cases of token to map, item list to map, and compendium to map.

# Version 3.0.1
  * Tweaked the size of the aspect labels added to the map to be slightly wider and higher.
  * The aspects viewer now re-renders to show any changed aspect text if someone else edits the character's aspects while you're in the player aspect editor.
  * Various improvements and bug fixes to Foundry 0.8 compatibility
  * Track aspects added to the game's list of situation aspects now can't be edited from the situation aspect editor, but can be edited from the character sheet or track view of FU.

# Version 3.0.0
  * New version number as this is the first version compatible with Foundry 0.8.0 with many breaking changes.
  * Removed support for importing characters from Nick East's original system (It's been long enough now that anyoen who wished to import will already have done so, I think)

# Version 2.2.28
  * Minor bug fixes to the layout of the aspects on tracks in FU and modular fate character sheets.

# Version 2.2.27
    * Yet more tweaks to FU, amending the responsiveness of the aspect pane (and fixing it for non-GMs)
    * Changed hover effect on buttons that aren't rectangles so they look nicer.
    * FU window width now defaults to 0.5 of the width of the main Foundry window.

# Version 2.2.26
  * Further tweaks to the appearance of the new conflict filter icon.
  * Added some defaults to settings so they don't become undefined on using the 'reset defaults' button (until the world is next opened)
  * The Action Tracker is now at a fixed maximum width rather than a relative one, so it doesn't grow as you stretch the FU window out.
  * Acted tokens now have a washed out appearance to distinguish them visually from tokens that haven't acted without needing explicit headers.

# Version 2.2.25
  * Tweaked the position of the new icon for the conflict actors only filter.
  * The Game Notes page is now much more responsive than it was before to changes in size.

# Version 2.2.24
  * FU scene notes pane now much more responsive to changes in size and scrollY fixed.
  * The Scene Notes pane now expands and contracts organically as you add or subtract scene aspects to give maximal space to write notes in
  * Added a new toggle to the FU window in the conflict tracker that toggles between showing all actors in the scene, and all actors in the current conflict.
  * Added buttons to add new conflicts to the list of conflicts and cycle through the conflicts on the current scene.

# Version 2.2.23
  * Spent hours tweaking the appearance of FU tabs.
  * Set font size maximum in FU to 20. (Minimum was already set to 4)
  * Aspect boxes on tracks on character sheets and FU is now a percentage allowing them to grow.
  * Tweaked width of track names on character sheets.

# Version 2.2.22
  * Set ScrollY for the conflict tracker so it properly scrolls to the bottom when an update occurs.
  * Discovered that the auto-reszing code for Fate Utilities doesn't work in Firefox unless you set dom.visualViewport.enabled to true, so changed the code to use window.innerHeight instead of window.visualViewport

# Version 2.2.21
  * FU is back to using div elements to lay out the page, but is now done correctly and the tabs won't disappear from the page regardless of the scroll situation.
  * When you resize the FU window, it will now re-render based on the new size of the window to ensure that all components are laid out nicely and to minimise scrollbars.

# Version 2.2.20
  * FU no longer uses divs to layout the main parts of the page. This was a terrible mistake. Sorry!

# Version 2.2.19
  * The expand and contract aspect buttons in FU are now divs and the icon fully scales with the font size, as does the padding. This means that changing the size of the font in FU now allows the aspects tables to be significantly compressed.
  * Ditto for the expand and contract track buttons in FU.  

# Version 2.2.18
  * FU now uses DIVs rather than a table to layout its elements.

# Version 2.2.17
  * Changed the height property of FateUtilities to be equal to 0.9 of the viewport height. This allows it to be completely resizable.
  * The button to add a note about a track's aspect to the list of scene aspects wasn't working for NPCs, but it is now.

# Version 2.2.16
  * Fixed a layout bug in the presentation of player track information in Fate Utilities.
  * Controlling a token no longer causes FU to completely re-render, instead it changes the class of controlled token rows/tables to highlight their colour.
  * A dice roll now only causes FateUtilities to re-render if you're looking at the dice history at the time. It will of course re-render the roll tab when you click on it, ensuring the roll history is up-to-date.
  * Made similar changes so the game info tab and the scene tab will only re-render if those tabs are open when a re-render request is sent, or the next time those tabs are clicked.
  * In all, these should prevent a LOT of unnecessary renders of FateUtilities.

# Version 2.2.15
  * Added a little icon to tracks that have named aspects in Fate Utilities. When clicked, the aspect will be added to the list of situation aspects for the scene.

# Version 2.2.14
  * Fixed the height of the Action Tracker pane in Fate Utilities to 72vh to align it with the other panes and prevent it from scrolling the main FU headers out of view.
  * Tweaked the option for setting an initiative skill to add a 'Disabled' option. This enables you to disable the FU action tracker without setting an initiative skill.
  * Added the ability to double click the name in the action tracker to change the name of a token.

# Version 2.2.13
  * Fixed a bug that prevented an extra from copied from a token to the map or another character.
  * Fixed a bug (and Foundry default behaviour too, I think) that prevented an extra from being copied from a token character to another token character.
  * Fixed a typo that prevented the text for 'Create an Advantage' from appearing on clicking on a skill in the player skill editor.

# Version 2.2.12
  * Added a 'unact' button to change a character's status in the combat tracker to 'not acted'.
  * Disabled the Fate Utilities conflict action tracker if an initiative skill has been set, as you can use the standard combat tracking tools in this use case.

# Version 2.2.11
  * Controlled tokens' lines in the Combat Tracker of Fate Utilities are now highlighted in blue.
  * Clicking on the magnifying glass in the combat tracker will control the token (if owned) and release control of all other tokens.
  * Changed the display of actors who've acted so that the pan and character sheet buttons are still available.

# Version 2.2.10
  * Fate Utilities' combat tracker now has three buttons per character to make them act, to centre the canvas on their token, and to open their character sheet.

# Version 2.2.9
  * Fate Utilities now honours the choice of Fate Utilities font when you update a situation aspect's free invokes.
  * When you click on the Fate Utilities button, if FU is alread open it will be brought to the top of the application stack.
  * You can now right-click on an avatar in the combat action tracker window to open that character's sheet.

# Version 2.2.8
  * Made the default for FUAspectLabelSize 0 - this will automatically size the text to a percentage of the current scene width.
  * Added a Font setting for FUAspectLabelFont

# Version 2.2.7
  * Added a system setting to override the size of the font used in aspect labels created from Fate Utilities.

# Version 2.2.6
  * Created an override in preCreateActor hook so you cannot create a Thing except by dragging a token to the map.
  * Fixed a typo on a language string name in the ManageSkills source (ModularFate.Name).
  * Added an option in Fate Utilities to increase or decrease the size of the font used, making it easier to compress the window into a smaller space.

# Version 2.2.5
  * Fixed a bug where a reroll with a fate point wasn't producing a chat message if you're a player.
  * Container improvements 1: Things that represent containers no longer contain an item representing themselves (this should reduce confusion about the way Things work)
  * Container improvements 2: Things that represent containers can only be converted back to regular items when they are empty. This will restore a copy of the original item that created the Thing (if created from an item by dragging to the map)
  * Extras can now contain static data items representing their contents. This allows nesting containers and various other enhancements.
  * Updated the ModularFate actorsheet to show the contents of extras that contain other extras.
  * Things now use linked actors for everything, so each item put on the map will create a new Item. This is a breaking change for anyone who already had items out on their maps prior to this release, sorry.
  * However, this should solve a lot of other thorny problems! The system will also clear up after itself when you create and delete tokens by removing the related actors. This means your ModularFate/Things folder ought to be empty unless you have Thing tokens out on ANY map in your current game world.
  * Player characters can now pick up entire containers if they're set to 'movable'.
  * They can also empty out all of the contents of a container.
  * Containers can now contain other containers and their contents. It's Russian dolls all the way down.
  * Manipulating Things still requires a GM to be logged in for it to work properly!
  * Tidied up behaviour of containers a bit to make life easier, including getting rid of some redundant data values in Things for their container attributes.
  * You shouldn't EVER create Things directly; let the system handle it for you when you drag an item on to the map.

# Version 2.2.4
  * If a GM isn't logged in and players have permission to create actors, a non-GM player doing so will now cause the actor to be properly initialised.
  * Removed bug that sometimes caused an actor's sheet not to refresh after initialisation with game defaults.
  * Made it impossible for non-GMs to open Thing sheets from the actor list (to prevent spoilers and odd scenarios like players taking items from Things before they're even on the map. Note that once you've dragged an item to the map players will be able to see it in the list of ModularFate Things under the Actors list, so to maintain surprises only drag items to the map when ready for players to see them.)
  * Dragging out an item to make a token will now replace the corresponding existing Thing with the new item.

# Version 2.2.3
  * Things now set the container avatar by default to be the same as the item being dragged out to create the Thing. Container avatars can still be changed normally after creation.
  * If an extra has a blank cost field, it won't cause spent refresh to be calculated as NaN.
  * Fixed a bug that was preventing refresh all from working if Things were on the scene.
  * Changed the logic that dtermines whether to initialise a character to ensure character initialising doesn't happen when copying an actor that has already been initialised.

# Version 2.2.2
  * Prevented automatic spawning of the skill editor window on creating a new character.
  (It was annoying me)
  * Refactored the code used to initialise characters' stress tracks from skills and to initially set up characters to increase efficiency.
  * Refactored to add a ModularFateActor class to make it somewhat easier to override the sheet without also overriding a lot of core data manipulation processes. 
  * Moved hooks and processes that modify actors to this class.

# Version 2.2.1
  Added a setting to invert the behaviour of dragging an extra on to a Thing or other owned character. Change this setting to make NOT deleting on transfer the default, but click-shift-drag will still delete.

# Version 2.2.0
  Added a new system for managing Extras as tokens, including as containers for other extras. THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH the module PICK-UP STIX.
  There is a new setting to allow or disallow players from creating item tokens (Player Thing Token Creation) - leave this set to false if you don't want players to be able to create item tokens.
  It's necessary for a GM to be logged in for players to be able to create item tokens or for a token representing a single item to be deleted once they've taken that item.
  This was a fairly complex feature to implement and there may be bugs, especially in multi-GM environments. Please let me know if you encounter any issues!

  ##How does this work?
  * When you drag and drop an item to the scene, the system checks to see if a Thing (a new type of actor for Modular Fate) already exists of the same name.
  * If it does, no new Thing is created, but a new token is created based on the existing Thing.
  * This means that if you change an item after making a Thing for it, you'll need to delete the Thing (you'll find them in the ModularFate Things folder of your actors folder) and re-create it.
  * The tool works this way to prevent a proliferation of Thing actors every time you create a new token on a scene for an extra.
  * Thing tokens are unlinked. That means once they're on a scene you can change them as much as you like and no change will occur to the original actor or item.
  * When you drag an item on to a Thing actor, it will be deleted from its original container whether that is an actor or another sheet. Likewise, when you drag an extra from one owned actor to another, the item will be deleted.
  * You can override the deletion by clicking the item, then holding shift, then dragging the item to its destination. 
  * Thing tokens are either items or containers. If they're an item they can only hold one extra and attempts to add more will fail. GMs can change them between items and containers as long as they have only one item in them.
  * You can create Thing actors directly (for example to create a custom container without having to create an item first) from the actor creation menu by choosing the Thing character type.  
  * Things that represent containers can have a separate image assigned; things representing items will use the contained item's image.

# Version 2.1.8
  Moved the expand/collapse all extras buttons to the right of the bar and changed the colour of the 'add extra' plus to match the other buttons in the menu bar.

# Version 2.1.7
  Adjusted the scaling of the biography etc. panel on the Modular Fate character sheet so that the biography and description tabs can be scrolled on exceeding the space allowed rather than forcing extras off the bottom of the sheet.
  Added ability to expand and collapse individual extras and all of a character's extras at once (per session setting; will be cleared on refresh)
  Added ability to expand and collapse the biography, extra and description panels on the ModularFate character sheet.

# Version 2.1.6
  Using a trick I learned from @Moo Man (Thanks!), adding or removing a batch of skills from a character is now completed in a single update rather than one per skill.

# Version 2.1.5
  Significantly improved performance when adding or deleting an extra that contains stunts, tracks, skills etc. by disabling sheet re-renders caused by updates until all additions or deletions have been processed by the database engine.
  Further improved by making all updates happen in one chunk rather than multiple separate updates.

# Version 2.1.4
  Bugfix; deleting a situation aspect wasn't deleting the related note from the scene.

# Version 2.1.3
  Tweaked some settings in Fate Utilities to make the size of elements relative to the viewport height.

# Version 2.1.2
  Checked for compatibility with 0.7.9
  Added localization strings for the initaitive skill setting to en.json
  Replaced a reference to actor.data.items to actor.items

# Version 2.1.1
  Bug fix; if (working_data.data.details.fatePoints.refresh == "") resolved to true when refresh set to 0, causing the system to treat new tokens created with 0 refresh as new actors, and thus initialise their character sheets on dropping the token on the board.
  Added a setting for an initiative skill. If this is set, the combat tracker will set character's initiative value to the chosen skill when you 'roll' initiative.

# Version 2.1.0
  Bug fix; added the concat handlebars helper (this was in a module on my system so I didn't realise it wouldn't work for everybody)

# Version 2.0.9
  Deleting a token that has been enrolled in a conflict from the scene without also deleting the combatant no longer cause Fate Utilities to stop working.
  Combatants that have been marked as defeated in the combat tracker are no longer shown in the FU conflict tracker.
  This doesn't work if you set the token as dead, unconscious etc. from the status effects from the token as this does NOT set the 'defeated' flag on the token.

# Version 2.0.8
  Fixed error that appeared when making a change to tokens etc. when the stunt database window was open.
  Set Aspect width to a percentage rather than a fixed value in Fate Utilities to make it easier to see the full aspect text.
  Clicking to expand or contract a stunt, aspect or track on character sheet no longer expands/contracts an aspect, stunt or track with the same name
  Changing the name of a situation aspect with a notecard on the scene now changes the aspect text on the notecard.
  Layout improvements to various tables in Fate Utilities
  Deleting a situation aspect with a blank name now doesn't delete the first drawing found (false positive searching for a picture with title containing "")

# Version 2.0.7
  Rerolls from Fate Utilities now make a chat message appear. This means that Dice So NIce now shows for rerolls, and also you can see the exact value of rerolls in the chat history if that's something you need.

# Version 2.0.6
  Situation and Game Aspects in Fate Utilities are now editable and the workflow of creating them has been altered to solve a bug with aspects not being created due to timing of renders etc.
  Hitting return on an input field (but not a text area or contenteditable DIV) will now save out the data and unfocus the field.

# Version 2.0.5
  Confirmed functional with 0.7.8 and incremented version number in System.json
  
# Version 2.0.4
  Changed behaviour of clicking on avatars in Fate Utilities. 
  Clicking on the avatar now opens the character sheet.
  Right clicking switches between token and actor avatars as left-clicking did before.
  An errant colon has been taken outside and shot.

# Version 2.0.3
  Layout tweaks and added a couple of localisation strings.

# Version 2.0.2
  Amended the size of the column for aspect names in Fate Utilities to be a percentage rather than a fixed value so it resizes with the Fate Utilities window.
  Ditto size of the character names in the roll history tab.
  You can now add and edit aspect notes from the character sheet and Fate Utilities.
  You can now and and eddit track notes directly on the character sheet/Fate Utilities without a separate pop-up dialogue.
  Added a new tab to Fate Utilities that stores notes on the game date and time, general game notes (available from all scenes) and game aspects (sorted by name; if you want to group them give them a prefix like "Issue: Who Let The Dogs Out?")

# Version 2.0.1
  Added the ability to collapse and expand the view of aspects and/or tracks in Fate Utilities to make it easier to focus on specific characters of interest at a given moment.
  This is stored PER SESSION, so you can close and re-open Fate Utilities and the expansion settings will persist, but these will be lost upon refreshing the browser or restarting Foundry.

# Version 2.0.0
  Added some extra debouncing code in the RenderMe methods of the various character editors.
  Fixed a layout bug with the stress tracks in Fate Utilities; they are now aligned left again.
  Set borders to 2px rather than 1px for a cleaner visual separation of characters and rolls.

# Version 1.9.9
  Tokens in Fate Utilities are now sorted by name. This means they are always displayed in the same order.
  Controlled tokens' track and aspect entries in Fate Utilities are now coloured blue so you can see which token is selected for the purposes of applying stress etc. to the right token.
  You can double-click on the name of a token in Fate Utilities to change the name of the token.
  Added localization strings for the new dialogs needed to support the above name change feature.

# Version 1.9.8
  Fixed a bug in the localization text strings where the advanced roll was rendering 'NaN' instead of Stunt.

# Version 1.9.7
  Data packs for default releases now embedded in language files for ease of translation.

# Version 1.9.6
  Now supports localization. So far only English is supported, but the whole system has localisation strings so that volunteers can provide translations if they wish.

# Version 1.9.4 and version 1.9.5
  Added two settings to the Settings menu for GMs, allowing them to export all configuration options for the world (except enforce columns and enforce skills settings).
  This allows all tracks, skills, stunts in the stunt database, and aspects to be exported or imported by pasting the JSON for them into a text box or copying the text out of a text box.
  Use with caution; the import function will override all existing settings on your world. To cancel without making any changes, exit out of the import dialog without hitting the save button.

# Version 1.9.3
  Efficiency improvements; prevented situation where there would be multiple updates to FateUtilities when multiple GMs are logged in, other minor improvements to the code.

# Version 1.9.2
  Further bugfixes; stunt editing window wasn't closing due to a change in the base code.

# Version 1.8.9
  Tested for compatibility with Foundry 0.7.6
  Killed yet ANOTHER bug that was preventing FateUtilities from being re-rendered; this time the bug was caused by some old code on character sheets that was no longer needed, but which caused FateUtilities to be removed from the list of apps to render on an UpdateToken event whenever a character sheet was closed.

# Version 1.8.8
  Aspects provided by extras now can't be edited except on the extra.
  Fixed a bug with regard to the updating of aspects, skills, etc. from items.
  Fixed a bug in which adding aspects to the scene no longer worked after drawings were placed on (or deleted from) the scene that had no text content.
  Re-added the dice icon to stunts provided by extras so that rolls can be made easily with stunts that have a linked skill from the character sheet.

# Version 1.8.7
  FINALLY caught a bug that was preventing the action buttons from triggering a re-render in the Fate Utilities combat tracker.
  The issue was caused by a render called on clicking between FateUtilities tabs. This was interfering with the proper render following someone having taken their action.

# Version 1.8.6
  The initiative tracker in Fate Utilities will now only set all tokens on the scene as having not acted if you select "Yes" when the interface asks if you wish to delete the combat.
  The initiative tracker now supports ending just one combat in a scene and leaving the others running without changing the 'hasacted' status of each token.
  The 'next exchange' button now applies to the active combat only.
  On pressing the 'next exchange' or 'end conflict' buttons, all changes are now pushed as a single update, improving efficiency.
  
# Version 1.8.5
  Fate Utilities bug fixes (some of those 'awaits' I removed in 1.8.4 were still needed!)
  Added an 'already acted' list to the action tracker.

# Version 1.8.4
  Further improvements to the rendering of FateUtilities; added a debounce function so that multiple successive renders won't cause repeated renders, significantly improving performance.
  Found a couple of other bugs that were preventing renders of FateUtilities as a result of focusout being used instead of blur
  Properly implemented the option to click on avatars in Fate Utilities' Aspects view to switch between avatar image and token image.
  This now propagates properly to connected clients.
  Removed the chat message that was emitted on a character taking an action. In my experience this basically just spammed the chat as the GM and players are aware of who's acting either through talking with each other or by watching the characters disappearing from the combat tracker.
  Removed a bunch of unnecessary 'await' keywords from FateUtilities that were slowing down the user experience. These are not necessary in most cases because the window re-renders on receiving hook events such as 'updateToken' which are fired once the update is complete.
  Removed the socket request to GM upon a player making a dice roll to have it logged in the FateUtilities dice history. This is not necessary as the GM is monitoring the chatmessage hooks for dice rolls.
  The overall effect of these changes should be a significant boost to performance when FateUtilities is open, especially if you're the GM and especially if you're using Multi-Level Tokens.

# Version 1.8.3
  Fixed a pernicious bug where changing a value in a numeric input box with the up and down arrows (spinner) would freeze updates of FateUtilities and the character sheet even after focusing out of them.
  This is because the spinners don't trigger focusout events when used. 
  Switched focusout to blur as the event type and this is now working properly in all tested cases.

# Version 1.8.2
  Bugfix; deleted two now unnecessary lines of code that were causing errors.

# Version 1.8.1
  The Rolls tab and the Situation Aspects tabs of Fate Utilities now automatically scroll to the bottom when a new entry is added, making it easier to keep track of them when FateUtilities is open.
  
# Version 1.8.0
  Made some improvements to FateUtilities. Creating a situation aspect is now done first and then free invokes added afterwards.
  This prevents FU from locking up (i.e. stopping renders) while the number of free invokes is selected.
  Also added ScrollY settings to the situation aspect pane and the scene notes pane so that these panes will remember their specific scroll settings when the Fate Utilities app is re-rendered.

# Version 1.7.9
  Bug fixes to Extras changing character stats. Skill changes on Extras were not updated on characters due to a bug in the logic handling this.

# Version 1.7.8
  Added the ability to import and export tracks, skills, and aspects from the system settings menu.

# Version 1.7.7
  Added a per-user setting to request confirmation prior to deletion of stunts, extras, aspects, etc.
  Fixed a bug in the code that handles adding data from extras to the character; this was not deleting data items that were removed from the extra instead of deleting the whole extra.

# Version 1.7.6
  Fixed a bug where extras on skills were being counted towards the skill total for skill total enforcement even if the boolean for counting the extra's skills had been set to false.

# Version 1.7.5
  You can now right-click on a skill's name to bring up the description of the skill as entered by the GM.

# Version 1.7.4
  You can now export individual stunts as a JSON string, or import one or more stunts as a JSON string.
  If you composit together a multiple stunt import from several individual exported stunts,, ensure that you get the brackets right; it should be: 
  {
      "stunt name":{stunt},
      "stunt name":{stunt},
      ...
  }
  
  Example: I've exported two stunts, which are ready to be imported individually:

  {"Natural Weapon":{"name":"Natural Weapon","linked_skill":"None","description":"See page 158 of Dresden Files Accelerated","refresh_cost":"1","overcome":false,"caa":false,"attack":true,"defend":false,"bonus":"0","plusTwo":"deprecated"}}
  {"Superior Recovery":{"name":"Superior Recovery","linked_skill":"None","description":"See page 159 of Dresden Files Accelerated","refresh_cost":"1","overcome":false,"caa":false,"attack":false,"defend":false,"bonus":"0","plusTwo":"deprecated"}}

If I want to import them both at the same time, I need to reformat them into a single object like this:

{
  "Natural Weapon":{"name":"Natural Weapon","linked_skill":"None","description":"See page 158 of Dresden Files Accelerated","refresh_cost":"1","overcome":false,"caa":false,"attack":true,"defend":false,"bonus":"0","plusTwo":"deprecated"},
  "Superior Recovery":{"name":"Superior Recovery","linked_skill":"None","description":"See page 159 of Dresden Files Accelerated","refresh_cost":"1","overcome":false,"caa":false,"attack":false,"defend":false,"bonus":"0","plusTwo":"deprecated"}
}




# Version 1.7.3
  No changes to code base; the version number changes were required to get my house in order with respect to Foundry's releases.

# Version 1.7.1
  Minor bug fixes.

# Version 1.7.0
  This version supports Foundry 0.7.5. 
  When you add an extra with stunts, skills, aspects, or tracks to your character, each will be added to your own character's attributes for ease of reference.
  For example, if I add a Morph extra with an aspect "Morph Aspect 1", this will be added to my character's list of aspects.
  All objects added from Extras will be flagged with (Extra) so it's clear they aren't on your character.
  IMPORTANT: Notes/Limitations
  * You can't add more than one object with a given name from more than one extra. e.g. once I have an aspect called Morph Aspect 1 (Extra) on my sheet, I cannot add another of the same name even if the aspect text is different.
  * Skills added to your character from extras ARE NOT taken into account when calculating the number of boxes of tracks or whether a track is available to you.
    If you need a morph skill to modify a track, I suggest manually adding a track with the correct number of boxes etc. through the 'ad hoc track' option on the track and deleting the same track from the character's 'real' tracks.

# Version 1.6.7
  Added a countSkills boolean to the data type for extras. This allows us to determine in code whether to count skills on an extra towards the player's skill total, column, etc.

# Version 1.6.6
  Extras can now have stunts, skills, aspects, and tracks attached to them.
  Players can now edit their own tracks within the constraints of the tracks set up on the system. Only the GM can add ad-hoc tracks to a character or item.
  Mended an issue with adding multiple copies of non-unique tracks.

# Version 1.6.5
  Various small fixes in respect of simultaneous editing of values on characters/in Fate Utilities and other improvements. Tested for compability with Foundry 0.7.3 (with hotfix Foundry.js applied)
  
# Version 1.6.4
  Realised that there was a bug in the handling of refresh total. The character's refresh should be game refresh minus refresh spent.
  In addition to this I've sneaked in a few improvements to the concurrent editing of items in FateUtilities and on character sheets without making a full release.

# Version 1.6.3
  This is a new branch which is compatible with Foundry 0.7.2. So far the only change is to remove the deprecated isPlayer check in favour of hasPlayerOwner.

# Version 1.6.2
  You can now drag and drop an Extra from the character on to a Pick Up Stix chest or another character sheet, compendium, or item list. 
  This will remove it from the character sheet if dragged to pick up stix or another character sheet. but will NOT delete the item if dragged to a compendium or the item list.

# Version 1.6.0
  Added a new tool to FateUtilities; a roll log. This tool captures all rolls made on the actively viewed scene (caveat: for a player's roll to be captured, a GM user must be logged in)
  The GM can clear all rolls.
  The owner of the character that made a roll (and therefore the GM) can modify the roll with a +1 (for teamwork), +2 from a free invoke, +2 from a fate point, or a reroll from a free invoke or a fate point.
  These changes are then logged to the roll in the FateUtilities roll viewer.
  This utility works by capturing any 4dF roll made that goes to the chat log.
  Because the customised roll information is stored in scene flags, the data can't be updated by players. That's why a GM has to be logged in; a socket request is sent from the player to an active GM to make the change to the roll log.

# Version 1.5.0
  Added a new CSS file and default character sheet following significant work by Stargolum to refactor my inline styles etc. into something a lot more polished.
  If you run into any problems with the new default sheet or you want to revert to the original sheet for any reason, you can use the 'default sheet' setting and point it to 
  systems/ModularFate/templates/ModularFateSheet_legacy.html

# Version 1.4.2
  Added a track filter on the character sheet so that the view can be restricted to a single cateogry or all tracks.
  Modified the track filter in FateUtilities so that it gives the option of viewing all tracks or tracks in a single category.

# Version 1.4.0
  Added a stunt database feature.
  When viewing a character sheet, the GM can click on the 'upload' icon next to a character's stunt to save that stunt in the game world's stunt database.
  Clicking on the new book icon in the stunt header will let the GM or players view the stunt database and then click the 'download' button to add a stunt from the database to the character from which the database window was launched.
  The GM can also click on the trash icon to delete a stunt from the database.
  If a stunt is added but already exists in the database, this will overwrite the existing copy of the stunt with the new one.
  Once a stunt has been added to someone's character sheet, it is a local copy and changes to the database will not affect the character unless they go into the database and re-add the stunt. If they do this, the version on their sheet will be overwritten with the one from the database.

# Version 1.3.5
  Added a new feature in FateUtilities that lets you add a text note to the map for a situation aspect defined in the Aspects tab of FateUtilities.
  The first button creates a note (which is positioned at the centre of the visible portion of the screen)
  The second button pans to the note wherever it is, making it easier to find.
  The third button deletes the aspect and its related note as normal.
  The notes added with this function are drawings, so to move them or otherwise edit them you must use the Drawings layer.
  Also added an override sheet template option so you can provide a custom character sheet for the system to use. Use this option with caution.

# Version 1.3.4
  Bugfix to FateUtilities - TimedEvents had stopped working due to a scope issue

# Version 1.3.3
  Added override options to set tracks, aspects, and skills to the defaults for Dresden Files Accelerated.

  You can use the following code in a macro or just run from the console to create template characters that have been set up already with their tracks and other information:

# Version 1.3.2
  Bug fix; editing tracks was not quite working correctly.

# Version 1.3.1
  Minor bug fixes; combat tracker now sizes automatically. Improved code on mass addition or deletion of tokens to avoid the need for a hard-coded timeout.

# Version 1.3.0
  Added a utility for GMs who prefer to keep their NPCs under wraps (that is, with the players denied even Limited permissions)
  Click on the new binoculars item in the Tokens tool bar to the left of the screen and you can select a character or token to display, player(s) to show it to, and which parts of the character you want to display.
  Please note that this is a snapshot of the character at that time and the tracks and other data won't be updated. If the player closes this window you'll have to share it with them again using the SHow Character tool for them to get another look.

# Version 1.2.11
  Bug fix: Creating a track, aspect, or skill in the system menu options with a trailing space in the name caused the item to be uneditable.
  This has now been rectified.

# Version 1.2.10
  Bug fix: Consequences written on characters in FateUtilities weren't being stored properly. This has now been corrected.

# Version 1.2.9
  1. Stunt bonus is now a number rather than a boolean for +2/no +2. This allows for stunts costing multiple refresh that give a bonus of +4, or more broad stunts that give +1, etc. Any character with a +2 stunt will have this converted to a bonus of 2 when their character sheet is opened for the first time following this update.
  2. A modified roll dialog is now available. To use it, shift-click on a skill name on the character sheet, or shift click on the dice button in Fate Utilities after selecting a skill. The modified roll dialog lets you apply a specified bonus (for example, from full defence or teamwork), one or more stunts relevant to the chosen skill, or a second skill to be added to the roll. This last feature allows ModularFate to support two-column skill implementations of Fate Core with somewhat automated rolling. Standard rolls are still available by clicking on a skill or the dice icon on a stunt.

# Version 1.2.8
Very minor update:
  1. Added track and actor name to the track notes dialog.
  2. Changed theming of track notes to be the same as other user interfaces.
